Floppy Bird
=========
Initially, I wanted to try recreating Flappy Bird in HTML5, using a canvas and recycling the assets from the old game.

What I did instead is something way more primitive. This project uses nothing but good ol' div's for all the objects and graphics, will scale perfectly on almost any screen (mobile and desktop), is terribly unoptimized, laggy, and isn't nearly as fast as it would've been if I had just used a canvas instead. But here it is!

Notice
------
The assets powering the visual element of the game have all been extracted directly from the Flappy Bird android game.  
I do not own the assets, nor do I have explicit permission to use them from their creator. They are the work and copyright of original creator Dong Nguyen and .GEARS games (http://www.dotgears.com/).  
I took this Tweet (https://twitter.com/dongatory/status/431060041009856512 / http://i.imgur.com/AcyWyqf.png) by Dong Nguyen, the creator of the game, as an open invitation to reuse the game concept and assets in an open source project. There is no ill intention to steal the game, or claim it as my own. This is merely a recreation for fun.  
If the copyright holder would like for the assets to be removed, let me know!
